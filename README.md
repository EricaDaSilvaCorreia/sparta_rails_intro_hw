##### Challenges :

For this assignment I feel like the challenge was mor in processing all the information we got today. At first I was quite confused because I understood the logic behind doing it without scaffold  but it wasn't quite cemented yet for me so the getting things set up and getting started part of the assignment went a bit slow but once I got to google-ing and compairing the assingment to the examples we did earlier in the day things started to fall into place for me and I knew more or less what I had to do.

##### Take-Aways :

All in all I understand the concept, the similarities with what we did last week helped me find my footing and after that everything was okay. It's just the first day of working with rails so I'm just waiting to see how it goes. It is relatively easier than what we did last week but still there are things I can see will require a lot of practice.

I give it a 6/10.
